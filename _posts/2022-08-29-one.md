### About
For the first session of Open Studio we are celebrating. Stop in for a snack and meet some of the design faculty. There will be poster making on the Risograph and the student design organization, AIGA Mason, will be there to answer any questions and talk about what they do. You can also see what the space is and ask any questions you might have about the upcoming semester.
