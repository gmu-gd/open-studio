      <p class="intro">Open Studio is a space to work on projects (on your own computer or one of the iMacs in the room), gather with friends, get help from design faculty, or just relax. There will be workshops, talks, and demos throughout the semester so keep an eye here to see what's coming up. Check the schedule in the footer or on the about page to see when we are open. Open Studio is run by the School of Art.</p>

      <h3>What's Here</h3>
      <p>Currently there are <span class="highlight">12 iMacs</span>, <span class="highlight">2 flatbed scanners</span>, a <span class="highlight">small black and white laser printer</span>, and a <span class="highlight">risograph</span>. There are also tables to set up and work on your own computer or with other materials. If you want to cut or trim anything, there is a <span class="highlight">large cutting mat</span> and <span class="highlight">24" metal straight edge</span> in the space, please do not cut on the tables. There is also an <span class="highlight">electric saddle stitcher</span> available for binding. We ask that you refrain from eating in the space and you leave it cleaner than you found it.</p>
      <h3>Suggestions?</h3>
      <p>If you have a suggestion for workshops, demos, or other events you would like to see hosted in the space let us know. We are also up for suggestions on other tools and equipment you would like to have available. You can talk to anyone in the space or send an email to Michael at <span class="highlight">mmcderm8@gmu.edu</span>.
