      <p class="intro">Open Studio is staffed by members of the graphic design faculty in the School of Art. Each of us has some of the classes we have taught and some specific areas of expertise we have. We can all help with all the work you bring in but it might be helpful for you to find someone who has taught the class you are looking for help with or who has an expertise in the type of project you working on.</p>
